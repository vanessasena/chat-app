# Chat App
---

This is a chat app developed with Node.js during a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/).

After I completed the course, I developed some new features:
* User names should be unique in each room.
* Room names should be case insensitive.
* Show a list of rooms already in use so that the user can either choose one or enter in a new room.

There is a version running at [Heroku](https://chat-app-vst.herokuapp.com).
